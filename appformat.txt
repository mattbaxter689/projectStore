This is going to lay out the structure for the application:

What is the goal of this project?:
Overall the goal is to develop a program that will allow users to run said
program, add a project, and a message for what they did for the project on that
day. Eventually, as more projects are introduced, we will allow them to keep a
record of them, and select from their existing projects to add to. 

In the future, we can add things like exporting the work done for each entry
into a csv or a pdf file so that they can show the record of what they have
done. With this, we could give some metrics on the work done (like longest
submission streak etc)

APP STRUCTURE:

projectStore:
	-- config
		-- contains the file that will connect and start the database and pass
		it to the main function
			- function has been created to create the database. Now need the
			  models that I want to use for this. 



	-- pkg
		-- will contain the rest of the functions needed to grab the projects,
		get specific entries by project, add new entry to project etc



	-- models
		-- will contain the various structures for the project. Like project
		model, project entry model, response model etc.
